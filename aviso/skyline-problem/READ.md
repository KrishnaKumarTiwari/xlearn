# Skyline Probem 

A city skyline can be represented as a 2-D list with 1s representing buildings. In the
example below, the height of the tallest building is 4 (second-most right column).

[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]

Create a function that takes a skyline (2-D list of 0's and 1's) and returns

1) the height of the tallest skyscraper.
2) Location of the sky scrapper
3) Impossible constructions like missing floors etc.
